I will send the following text with channel coding and then perform decoding 

Text = "Basic Digital Communication with Networking"

Using the parity equations given below:
P1 = D1 + D4 + D5 + D7 + D9 + D10 + D11
P2 = D1 + D2 + D4 + D6 + D7 + D8 + D9
P3 = D2 + D3 + D5 + D7 + D8 + D9 + D10
P4 = D3 + D4 + D6 + D8 + D9 + D10 + D11

Part 1
The coding parameters (n,k,d) is determined 

Part 2
The generator matrix,G, at the channel encoder part is determine 

Part 3
Channel Encoding: by determining the parity check matrix, H from G for the channel decoder part.

Part 4
Coding: converting all the letters given above into their binary representation by using ASCII
table and apply (n,k,d) code above by using the generator matrix. 

Part 5
Interleaving: interleaving with a block size of 16 x 15 or 240 bits is applied.

Part 6
Framing: Serialize all the data into a row vector as if it is now ready to be sent over a binary symmetric
channel (BSC). As an indication of start of a frame append the serial data with 01111110. Moreover, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated and many random bits appended to the beginning of the serial data after the frame start. This way I will make the beginning of the frame unknown to the receiver. 

Part 7
Introduce errors

Part 8
De-Framing

Part 9
De-Interleaving

Part 10
De-Coding: by applying the syndrome decoding using the matrix H for the correction of error bits.
