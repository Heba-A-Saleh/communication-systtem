# CRC Features

Type of linear block codes
Data Link Layer
Error Detection Code
Single-Bit and Burst Error correction (Double bit error correction)

# CRC Design 

length of the block code = Polynomial Generator

Maximize the error detecting capabilities
Minimizing the remainder repetition.
Generates unique remainders 

# CRC Model (CRC-8)
Generator Size = 9-bits

Generator Hex. = 0xEA [1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]

Hamming Distance = 4 (Detect up to 3 )
