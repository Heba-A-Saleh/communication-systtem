# Discrete Signals and Signal Processing

Signal processing mainly deals with the analysis synthesis, and modification of signals.
The signal usually studied in frequency domain. Processing of signals can be done using several
methods, such as using gates to isolate the signal of interest or frequency filters to smooth or
reject unwanted frequencies.....etc. In this lab, we took a look on sounds, images and gyroscope
signal processing along with covering the discrete signals.

## Audio Sound Signals

When dealing with audio signals, noise interference is a vital element when processing
sound signals. To obtain a clear sound signal, all noises signals should be eliminated. This can be
achieved using low pass filters (op amps). Signal’s characteristics play a role in processing sound
signals. Frequency is directly proportional to the sound pitch, while signal’s amplitude
corresponds to the signal volume. The higher the amplitude the louder the sound. For adding and
removing several signal, using summing amplifiers. In this paper, we studied some of the sound
signal processing features using Matlab.

## Image Processing

An image is usually sampled into discrete values by its colours range (Pixels) the higher
the sampling rate the higher the image resolution (more smaller pixels).
Sampling and Nyquist theorem
Nyquist theorem states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum
frequency to obtain the original frequency. Lower sampling rate will result in the signal
distortion known as aliasing.
