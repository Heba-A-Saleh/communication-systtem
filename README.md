# Communication System 

## Projects

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB projects related to communication systems. The projects focus on implementing various error detection and correction techniques to ensure the reliability of communication systems.
Projects

### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

The first project in this repository is a CRC implementation. Cyclic Redundancy Check is an error detection technique used to detect errors in digital data. This project provides an implementation of the CRC algorithm in the programming language of your choice. The implementation can be used to check the integrity of data transmitted over a communication channel.

### Huffman Coding

The second project focuses on implementing the Huffman coding algorithm, which is a lossless data compression technique. It includes MATLAB code for encoding and decoding messages using the Huffman coding algorithm.

### Parity Check

The third project in this repository is a Parity Check implementation. Parity check is a simple error detection technique that involves adding a parity bit to a message. This project provides an implementation of the parity check algorithm in the programming language of your choice. The implementation can be used to detect errors in data transmitted over a communication channel.

### Signal Processing
The fifth project focuses on implementing various signal processing techniques that are commonly used in communication systems. It includes MATLAB code for filtering, modulation, demodulation, and other signal processing techniques.

## How to Use

Each project in this repository is self-contained and can be used independently. You can download the project source code and run it on your local machine or integrate it into your own project. The projects are designed to be easy to understand and modify, so you can customize them to suit your needs.

## Conclusion

By providing these projects, i hope to offer a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning about basic error detection and correction techniques in communication systems. Feel free to use these projects as a reference, learning tool, or starting point for your own project
