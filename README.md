# Communication System 

## Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects related to communication systems. The projects focus on implementing various error detection and correction techniques to ensure the reliability of communication systems.
Projects

### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

The first project in this repository is a CRC implementation. Cyclic Redundancy Check is an error detection technique used to detect errors in digital data. This project provides an implementation of the CRC algorithm in the programming language of your choice. The implementation can be used to check the integrity of data transmitted over a communication channel.

### Hamming Simulation

The second project in this repository is a Hamming simulation. Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes used for error detection and correction. This project provides a simulation of the Hamming code algorithm, where you can input a message and simulate the encoding and decoding process to see how errors can be detected and corrected.

### Parity Check

The third project in this repository is a Parity Check implementation. Parity check is a simple error detection technique that involves adding a parity bit to a message. This project provides an implementation of the parity check algorithm in the programming language of your choice. The implementation can be used to detect errors in data transmitted over a communication channel.

## How to Use

Each project in this repository is self-contained and can be used independently. You can download the project source code and run it on your local machine or integrate it into your own project. The projects are designed to be easy to understand and modify, so you can customize them to suit your needs.

## Conclusion

By providing these three projects, we hope to offer a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning about error detection and correction techniques in communication systems. Feel free to use these projects as a reference, learning tool, or starting point for your own project
