# Time and frequency domain analysis of the signals.

## Part a
First I generated a sample signal, x(t), where it is composed of 3 sinusoidal signals with frequencies 10, 20, and 50 Hz. 
1. To generate x[n] in time domain, The sampling time or frequencyis determined. Since the maximum frequency
content of x(t) is 50 Hz, our sampling frequency according to Nyquist Criterion should be at least
twice of 50 Hz, or 100 Hz. Over-sampling is done for better graphing 

                      x(t) = cos(2π10t) + cos(2π20t) + cos(2π50t)

## Part b
X(f) represent the discrete Fourier Transform of x[n]. Use Matlab’s fft function to perform this operation. Plot fft of
x[n]. 

## Part c
In order to shift the domain from [0 , 2π] to [ −π, π] I use another Matlab’s function: fftshift. Hence, after taking the fft of the signal x[n], also pass the fft signal through the function fftshift. The last step in seeing the frequency domain of x(t) is to convert [ −π, π] into frequency domain of Hz. For this, we use the fact that π corresponds to the half of the sampling frequency, Fs = 2. 

## Part d
Design a filter that will only keep 20 Hz component. These filters are called band-pass filters, i.e., they only pass the certain band in the middle of frequency domain component. 

## Part e
For frequency domain filtering, we know that the signal in time domain is passed through the filter, hence it is convolved with the system, h[n], but in frequency domain we have multiplication. Hence, multiply X(f) with H(f) to get Y (f)

## Part f

The time domain value of Y (f).
